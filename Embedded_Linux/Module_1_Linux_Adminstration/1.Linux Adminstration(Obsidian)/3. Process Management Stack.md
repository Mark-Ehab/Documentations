## <u><b>Definiton:</b></u>
`Process` = Program in <b><i>RAM</i></b>.
## <u><b>Terms:</b></u>
`Program`  = code that the programmer writes whether it's in <b><i>C</i></b> or <i><b>C++</b></i>.
`Priority` = the priority of process where this priority is given by the <i><b><u>kernel</u></b></i>, the developer can't force the kernel to give some process a specific priority, as a result of that the real time constrains can't be met using Linux, but there are some attempts to approach a real-time behavior however it will take some time.
`Deamon` = 
`Zombie` =
`Signal` = it is software interrupt signal has 3 things you need to know and you can actually know through some commands that we will discuss later, where these 3 things are:
	1. <u><b>sender</b></u>: the entity that sends the signal and it have more than one prospect which may be one of 3 --> `another process`, `the same process`, `kernel`.
	1. <u><b>receiver</b></u>: the process where the signal is sent to.
	2. <u><b>handler</b></u>: this is -for simplicity- the function That dictates how the receiver responds for example if this is a terminate-signal so, the handler may be designed to take some action like printing some sentence before terminating.
	there are a lot of signals that can be sent and we can display this using this command -> `kill -l`.
	![[signals_types.png]]
	
`Child process` = it is the process that is run by some other process (i.e., parent process).
`Parent process` = it is the process that runs some other process.

![[Parent_Child_processes.png]]
`init process` =

## <u><b>Operations: </b></u>
1. Run and create process.
3. send signal.
4. Set priority.
5. Change priority.
6. Trace process --> Syscalls.
7. Return value from process.
8. Restrict resources.
9. Get relation between processes.

## <b><u>Commands:</u></b>
 1. Run                      ---> `foreground` - `background`.
	process:
	![[process.png]]
	running in <u><i><b>foreground</b></i></u> the terminal is stuck till this process finishes or is terminated.
	![[foreground.png]]
	running in <u><i><b>background</b></i></u> using `&` operator where in this case the terminal can be used without taking into consideration the processing of this process as it runs in the background and another process can be run in the same time.
	![[background.png]]
	and the view of the `top` command to check this process 
	![[view_of_top_command.png]]
	converting the <u><i><b>background</b></i></u> process to <u><i><b>foreground</b></i></u>.
	![[converting_background_to_foreground.png]]
	converting the <u><i><b>foreground</b></i></u> process to <u><i><b>background</b></i></u>.
	![[converting_foreground_to_background.png]]
	these are the states that the process can be in 
	![[process_states.png]]
	
 2. Send signal          ---> `kill`.
	 an entity as kernel, process as terminal, the receiver process can send a signal using kill command to another process.
	 ![[kill_command.png]]
	 or for more info about kill command you can run this command 
	 `man kill` this will show the man page of the kill command.
	 this command shows some of the signals that can be sent `kill -l`.
	 ![[signals_types.png]]
	 there are some actions that are taken when a signal is sent to a process as the following:
	 ![[signals_actions.png]]
	 as seen in the pic there are `Term`, `Ign`, `Core`, `Stop`, `Cont`.
	here is more illustration for the core dump file what is it, how to analyze it and how to generate it.
	<u><b>Definition:</b></u> it is file in computer's documented memory when a program or computer crashes It consists of a recorded state of the working memory of the computer program at a particular point in time, usually when the program crashes.
	<b><u>Contents: </u></b> 1. Part of the program that was aborted
			 2. State of the processor
			 3. Contents in the processor's register
			 4. Information on memory management
			 5. Counter and stack pointer of the program
			 6. Operating system, processor information, and any flags
	<b><u>How to generate it: </u></b> type the following commands:
	`ulimit -c unlimited` : is used to set the **maximum size of a core dump file** as you can type this `ulimit -c` and if the output is **0** then the core dump file won't be generated as the size is 0.
	`sudo sysctl -w kernel.core_pattern=./core.%e.%p.%t` : this will make the core dump file to be generated in the --> `./` <b><u>(current directory)</u></b>, `%e` (means the **executable name** without the path), `%p` (means the ***PID***), `%t` (means the timestamp of the crush in seconds).
	so, if the process executable name is: **process** and its PID is: 6294 then the name of the core dump file will be <b><u>core.process.6294.1708626617</u></b> where **1708626617** is the timestamp as mentioned above.
	the process is 
	``` cpp
	#include <iostream> 
	#include <thread> 
	#include <iostream> 
	#include <cstdlib> 
	#include <ctime> 
	
	using namespace std; 
	using namespace std::chrono_literals; 
	
	void loadCPU() { 
		volatile double result = 0; 
		for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) { 
			result += std::rand() % 1000; 
		} 
	} 
	
	int main () 
	{ 
		std::srand(std::time(nullptr)); 
		while (true) { 
			int delay = std::rand() % 1 + 100; 
			loadCPU(); 
			loadCPU(); 
			cout << "Hello from process" << endl; 
		} 
	}
	```
	the running it and taking a view of the top process
	![[running_process.png]]
	the top command view
	![[top_view_of_the_running_processes.png]]
	so, then we will send a signal that should cause the generation of the  core dump file as in the following figure some of the signals from the **man** page
	![[some_signals.png]]
	we will send the SIGABRT signal we have two commands to send it
	``` command
	kill -6 <PID>
	kill -ABRT <PID>
	```

	![[ABRT_signal.png]]
	and the result is 
	![[result_of_ABRT_signal.png]]
	and the generated core dump file is
	![[generated_core_dump_file.png]]
	where its name is `core.process.7356.1708629007`.
	to debug it you can use the gdb but make sure it is installed first.
	``` command
	gdb --version
	```
	if not installed then
	``` command
	sudo apt install gdb
	```
	then debug using this 
	``` command
	gdb /path/to/executable /path/to/core-dump-file
	```
	![[result_of_gdb_session.png]]
	and there is more info in the <b><u><i>Extra info</i></u></b> section.

 Set priority          ---> `nice`.
 Change priority   ---> `renice`.
 Trace syscalls       ---> `strace`.
 Return result       ---> `observ`.
 Get relation         ---> `pstree`.
 Monitoring          ---> `top` - `ps`.
## <u><b>Files of interaction:</b></u>

```Path
/proc/...
```

![[proc_content.png]]
where <b><i>1</i></b>, <b><i>11326</i></b>, <b><i>1596</i></b> are folders there names are the PIDs (i.e., process IDs) of the processes that are running on the machine and theses folders contain info about the processes and the content is represented in the following pic.

![[process_1_info.png]]
these are the content of `/proc/1` where for example `/proc/1/stat` is the process status but in binary format not human readable format and to read it run the following command `cat /proc/1/stat` and the result will be.

![[proc_PID_stat.png]]
another example is `/proc/1/status` is the process status but in a human readable format and to read it run one of the following commands `cat /proc/1/status` , `less /proc/1/status` and the result will be.
