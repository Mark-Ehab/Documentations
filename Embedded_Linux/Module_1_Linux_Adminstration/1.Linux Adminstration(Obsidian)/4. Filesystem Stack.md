## 1. <b><u>Definition:</u></b>
<b><u><i>Filesystem stack</i></u></b> is the stack responsible for interfacing between the ***user-space*** and the hardware ***storage devices*** through providing the ***user-space*** with services to store and read the data from the storage devices where the ==responsibilities== of the <b><u><i>Filesystem stack</i></u></b> is the following:
1. Mapping between different views: as shown in the figure below of the layered architecture it takes the <b><i>file.txt</i></b> that is understood by the <b><i>user space</i></b> and convert it to a format that should be understood by the <b><i>Hardware</i></b> (i.e. binary format).
2. Understand different types of the file system (ext3, ext4, vfat, ...) and this is done through the ***==VFS==*** (Virtual File System).

### <b><u>VFS (Virtual Filesystem):</u></b>
The ***Virtual File System*** (also known as the Virtual Filesystem Switch):
1. it is the software layer in the kernel that provides the filesystem interface to userspace programs.
2. It also provides an abstraction within the kernel which allows different filesystem implementations to coexist in the run-time or before the run-time.
### <b><u>Root filesystem:</u></b>
the fact that the ***VFS*** provides the capability to mount (will cover this terminology later on but lets say for now deal with)  a lot of filesystem types during run-time, doesn't mean that the system can boot without any mounted filesystem, if this happens that the system boots without mounting any filesystem this will cause ***==kernel panic==*** and it won't boot.
Because of the above there is at least one mounted filesystem and this filesystem is called ***==root filesystem==*** this filesystem consists of some directories that will be covered later in the **files of interaction** section.
