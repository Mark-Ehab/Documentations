## 1. <b><u>Definition:</u></b>
<b><u>Real-time system:</u></b> it is the system where the correct functioning depends on 2 factors
                1. the <u><b>result</u></b> produced by that system.
                2. the <b><u>time</u></b> when this result is produced. 
## 2.<b><u>Types:</u></b>
### a. <i><b><u>Hard real-time system:</u></b></i>
this system is <i><b><u>purely deterministic</u></b></i> and <i><b><u>time constraint</u></b></i> system(i.e., the system should never miss its deadline).
ex: Air bag system
### b. <i><b><u>Soft real-time system:</u></b></i>
the meeting of the deadline isn't compulsory for every time for every task but the process should get processed and get result.
ex: mobile phones.

## 3. <b><u>Difference between GPOS and RTOS:</u></b>

| ***point of comparison*** | <u><b><i>RTOS</i></b></u>          | <u><b><i>GPOS</i></b></u>                                           |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Determinism               | yes                                | no                                                                  |
| predictable response time | yes                                | no                                                                  |
| time bound                | yes                                | no                                                                  |
| pre-emptive kernel        | yes                                | no (High priority tasks can't preempt kernel calls as in **Linux**) |
| priorities                | priority based scheduling          | priorities are dynamically adjusted                                 |
| memory resources          | limited                            | unlimited                                                           |
| ***extra point***         | works under worst case assumptions |                                                                     |
<u><b><i>Determinism:</i></b></u> it means random execution pattern 
            ex:    ***==GPOS==*** ----> if I clicked on google chrome it may open in 1 seconds or 10                                      seconds for example so, this system is not deterministic.
                ***==RTOS==***  ----> every task in ***RTOS*** is very deterministic where it's well known                            when this task will be executed and will last for how much time.
<u><b><i>Time bound:</i></b></u> it means does the process has time limits or like apps in windows for example can                            run forever. 
<b><u><i>pre-emptive kernel:</i></u></b> it means that the <b><u>high priority</u></b> tasks can't preempt the <b><u>kernel calls</u></b> which                                          means that as in Linux the high priority task is less important for the kernel                                       than some of its own services.
<b><u><i>priorities are dynamically adjusted:</i></u></b> means that the priorities can be adjusted <b><u>during the run time</u></b>.

## 4. <b><u>RTOS in layered architectures:</u></b>
### a. ***illustrative diagram:***
![[illustrative diagram (not standard).png]]
<b><u><i>Note:</i></u></b>
<b><u><i>RTOS</i></u></b> is communication with <b><u><i>HW</i></u></b> for the following reasons:
1. accessing the <i><b>HW-timer</b></i>.
2. Context switching.
3. packing and unpacking
these three points will be illustrated later.
