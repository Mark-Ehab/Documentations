### <b><u>Time driven:</b></u>

#### a. <b><u>First approach:</u></b>
```c
unsigned long int tickCounter = 0;
ISR(TIMER){
	tickCounter++;
}

void main(void){
	while(TRUE){ // super loop
		/* check the passage of 100ms */
		if((tickCounter % 100) == 0){
			doSomething(1);
		}

		/* check the pasage of 500ms */
		if((tickCounter % 500) == 0){
			doSomething(2);
		}
	}
}
```
this code snippet represents ***==one approach==** to the time-driven paradigm where the `tickCounter` is the variable that represents the smallest time unit that is calculated by the ***HW-timer***.
where this approach isn't the best if the intended behavior is the ***hard-time*** behavior because of the following. lets consider the following scenario:
if the `tickCounter` = **500ms** this will fit the ***first*** and ***second*** conditions where `500 % 100 = 0` and
`500 % 500 = 0` so, in this scenario if the interrupt does interrupt the program lets say at the first condition so, `doSomething(1);`  will be executed first and `doSomething(2);` will be ***==delayed==*** till `doSomething(1);` is processed and this will make this system unable to meet the **hard-time** constrains, and the same thing will happen if the interrupt interrupts at the second condition.
so, this block of code has the following characteristics:
1. ***Time-driven***: as the entity that drives the flow of the program is the tick.
2. ***Non-blocking***: as this code doesn't block the ***CPU*** it will just keep going till one of the                                       conditions is met. 
3. ***No prioritization handling***: as from the illustration above one of the 2 functions either                                                           `doSomething(1);` or `doSomething(2);` will be handled before the                                                 other despite there priorities if `doSomething(2);` has more                                                           priority but the **PC** (i.e., program counter) is on `doSomething(1);`                                                 so, `doSomething(1);` will be handled first as the condition is met                                                 regardless of the priority.
4. ***Time-delays will cause problem***: of course, any time delay will lead to the failure of the system                                                       to meet the hard-time requirements.
5. ***Can't meet real-time requirements***.

#### b. <b><u>Second approach:</u></b>
```c
void main(void){
	int data = 0;
	/* Checks if there an input from the user */
	if(getUserInput(&data) == TRUE){
		doSomething();
	}
	/* delay 1sec. */
	delay(1000);
}
```
this code snippet represents another approach of the ***time-driven*** system where this code will check the input from the user every ***1 second***, but this will waste the ***CPU*** because of the used delay and also won't meet the hard real-time requirements as if there is more functions to execute after this delay this approach will fail to meet the real-time requirements.

### <b><u>Event driven:</b></u>

#### a. <b><u>First approach:</u></b>
```c
char FLAG_EVENT_1 = FALSE , FLAG_EVENT_2 = FALSE;
ISR(Event1){
	FLAG_EVENT_1 = TRUE;
}
ISR(Event2){
	FLAG_EVENT_2 = TRUE;
}

void main(void){
	while(TRUE){ // Super loop
		/* Checking on the flag of the first event */
		if(FLAG_EVENT_1 == TRUE){
			FLAG_EVENT_1 = FALSE;
			doSomething(1);
		}

		/* Checking on the flag of the second event */
		if(FLAG_EVENT_2 == TRUE){
			FLAG_EVENT_2 = FALSE;
			doSomething(2);
		}
	}
}
```
this code snippet represents ***==one approach==*** to the event-driven paradigm where `FLAG_EVENT_1`, `FLAG_EVENT_2` are raised if on of the events happens.
where this approach isn't the best if the intended behavior is the ***hard-time*** behavior because of the following. lets consider the following scenario:
if **Event1** and **Event2** both happened and the interrupt happens where the ***PC*** is on the first condition so, what will happen is the following -regardless of the priority of `doSometing(1);` or `doSomething(2);`- `deSomething(1);` will be handled first even if `doSomthing(2);` has the higher priority, and according to that the real-time requirements won't be met.
so, this block of code has the following characteristics:
1. ***Event-driven***: where the flow is driven by the flags --> `FLAG_EVENT_1` or `FLAG_EVENT_2` where                         one of them or both will be raised when their corresponding event happens.
2. ***Non-blocking***: as this code doesn't block the ***CPU*** it will just keep going till one of the                                       conditions is met. 
3. ***No prioritization handling***: as from the illustration above one of the 2 functions either                                                           `doSomething(1);` or `doSomething(2);` will be handled before the                                                 other despite there priorities if `doSomething(2);` has more                                                           priority but the **PC** (i.e., program counter) is on `doSomething(1);`                                                 so, `doSomething(1);` will be handled first as the condition is met                                                 regardless of the priority.
4. ***Time-delays will cause problem***: of course, any time delay will lead to the failure of the system                                                       to meet the hard-time requirements.
5. ***Can't meet real-time requirements***.

#### b. <b><u>Second approach:</u></b>
```c
void main(void){
	int data = 0;
	/* polling technique: waiting till the user inputs the required data */
	while(getUserInput(&data) == TRUE);

	/* after the user inputs the data this function will be executed */
	doSomething();
}
```
this technique is called ***==polling==*** where the program sticks till the user inputs the required data so, if there is any function after `doSomething();` it won't be executed till `doSomething();` is executed first, so, this definitely won't meet the ***real-time requirements*** and won't handle the ***prioritization***.

### <b><u>Extra note on time-driven and event-driven:</b></u>
Sometimes when using <u><b>time-driven</b></u> architecture the ***CPU*** spends most of its time doing nothing useful or executing the ***==IDLE==*** task( we can say increasing the ***CPU load***).
and Sometimes using <b><u>event-driven</u></b> architecture optimizes the usage of the ***CPU*** as it's triggered to execute some task only when an event happens( we can say decreasing the ***CPU load***).
<i><b><u>But,</u></b></i> depending on the requirements of the system the architecture of the system can be ***time-driven*** or ***event-driven*** or combination of them both ***(nothing is perfect but the choice is according to the requirements)***.
